      <h2>This is who i am!</h2>
      <p>Hello my People i am Anthony... Anthony Kimble at your service, and I'm passionate about being a software engineer and creating great software 
        that will benefit Humanity. I'm also an upcoming photographer/videographer who is also designing his own website for the photography company that I'm currently 
        building independently. Last but not least I'm also a poet by heart, i sometimes find myself rhyming words unconsciously while talking to people in random conversations.
        So with that being said I'm also a pretty good freestylist, banging them bars all the way down the walkway. That's pretty much me in a nutshell in my current mental state.</p>
