      <p>Hello my People i am Anthony... Anthony Kimble at your service, and I'm passionate about being a software engineer and creating great software 
         that will benifit Humanity. I'm also a upcoming photographer/videographer who is also designing his own website for the photography company taht im currently 
         building independently. Last but not least im also a poet by heart, i sometimes find my self rhyming words unconscously while talking to people in random conversations.
         So with that being said im also a pretty good freestylist, banging them bars all the way down the walk way. That's pretty much me in a nut shell in my current mental state.
