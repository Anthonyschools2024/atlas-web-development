In this project we will be learning the advanced methods of styling your webpage. We will be adding on style from the previous project which was 
the HTML Advanced project that we just did. We basically built the skeleton of a webpage using html, now it is time to add the styling that brings
out the spunk of the webpage. Im looking forward to seeing what new methods i can learn from this project.
